	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the input size. Efficient algorithms aim for lower time complexity to solve problems quickly.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> is the measure of how much memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. For instance, an algorithm with space complexity O(n) requires memory that grows linearly with the input size.</p>
