	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>
        Time complexity is an important concept. Efficient algorithms run faster as input size grows.
    </p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> is the measure of how much memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. For instance, an algorithm with space complexity O(n) requires memory that grows linearly with the input size.</p>
